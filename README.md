👋 Hi, I’m @Dyuelber.

👀 I am interested in learning golang and serverless architecture.

🌱 I learned and worked for a while with mysql, php, javascript and vue.js with laravel framework, focusing on microservices.

😏 I'm currently learning and working with typescript, with mongodb as a database, focused on microservices, for the front-end I use the angular framework.
